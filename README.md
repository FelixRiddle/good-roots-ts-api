# Frontend good roots apis

Frontend good roots apis

# Rules

- Don't use nodejs only modules

This API is supposed to work on the frontend too.

# Testing

Remember to run servers before testing

Jest is not working, so I'm gonna make a tiny testing lib

# Backend api key access

There's no problem with this in the frontend as long as you don't put the backend server public on the internet.
